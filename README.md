## Installation

### Setup
To set up the portfolio:
```
git clone https://github.com/ge1118/portfolio-website.git
npm install
npm start
```

## Deployment
The Portfolio Site is deployed on Netlify, a popular web hosting platform, and can be visited at: [Leah's Portfolio Website](https://leah-portfolio-website.netlify.app/). It showcases the responsive design and features of the site in action.

Netlify offers efficient hosting and seamless integration with Git repositories, allowing for quick updates and continuous deployment. As a static site host, Netlify provides fast loading times and high performance. However, do note that initial access might take a few moments, especially after recent updates or prolonged inactivity, as the site rebuilds and caches content for optimal delivery.
